#' @srrstats {G2.11} *Software should ensure that `data.frame`-like tabular
#'  objects which have columns which do not themselves have standard class
#'  attributes (typically, `vector`) are appropriately processed, and do not
#'  error without reason. This behaviour should be tested. Again, columns
#'  created by the [`units` package]
#'  (https://github.com/r-quantities/units/) provide a good test case.*
