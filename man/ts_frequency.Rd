\title{Change Frequency}
\usage{
ts_frequency(x, to = "year", aggregate = "mean", na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ts-boxable time series, an object of class \code{ts}, \code{xts}, \code{zoo},
\code{data.frame}, \code{data.table}, \code{tbl}, \code{tbl_ts}, \code{tbl_time}, \code{tis}, \code{irts} or
\code{timeSeries}.}

\item{to}{desired frequency, either a character string (\code{"year"},
\code{"quarter"}, \code{"month"}) or an integer (\code{1}, \code{4}, \code{12}).}

\item{aggregate}{character string, or function. Either \code{"mean"}, \code{"sum"},
\code{"first"}, or \code{"last"}, or any aggregate function, such as \code{\link[base:mean]{base::mean()}}.}

\item{na.rm}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, incomplete periods are aggregated as
well. For irregular series, incomplete periods are always aggregated.}
}
\value{
a ts-boxable time series, with the same class as the input.
}
\description{
Changes the frequency of a time series. By default, incomplete
periods of regular series are omitted.

# Note that incomplete years are omited by default
