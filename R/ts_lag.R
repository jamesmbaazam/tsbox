#' Lag or Lead of Time Series
#'
#' Shift time stamps in ts-boxable time series, either by a number of periods or
#' by a fixed amount of time.
#'
#' The lag order, `by`, is defined the opposite way as in R base. Thus, -1 is a
#' lead and +1 a lag.
#'
#' If `by` is integer, the time stamp is shifted by the number of periods. This
#' requires the series to be regular.
#'
#' If `by` is character, the time stamp is shifted by a specific amount of time.
#' This can be one of one of `"sec"`, `"min"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`,
#' `"month"`, `"quarter" or `"year", optionally preceded by a (positive or
#' negative) integer and a space, or followed by plural "s". This is passed to
#' [base::seq.Date()]. This does not require the series to be regular.
#'
#' @inherit ts_default
#' @param by integer or character, either the number of shifting periods
#'   (integer), or an absolute amount of time (character). See details.
#'
#' @return a ts-boxable time series, with the same class as the input. If time
#'  stamp shifting causes the object to be irregular, a data frame is returned.

#' ts_plot(AirPassengers, ts_lag(AirPassengers), title = "The need for glasses")

#' ts_lag(fdeaths, "1 month")
#' ts_lag(fdeaths, "1 year")
#' ts_lag(ts_df(fdeaths), "2 day")
#' ts_lag(ts_df(fdeaths), "2 min")
#' ts_lag(ts_df(fdeaths), "-1 day")
